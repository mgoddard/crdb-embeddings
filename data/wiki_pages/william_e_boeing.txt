William Boeing's first design was the Boeing Model 1 (or B & W Seaplane), which first flew in June 1916, a month before the company was founded. He also helped create the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (known as "United Airlines" today) in 1929 and served as its chairman. He received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1934 and was posthumously inducted in to the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, ten years after his death. ==Early life== File:Boeing Hohenlimburg01.jpeg|thumb|Metal plaque, Lenneuferstraße 33, Hagen-Hohenlimburg William Boeing was born in Detroit|Detroit, Michigan, to Marie M. Ortmann, from Vienna, Austria, and Wilhelm Böing (1846–1890)<!--, a wealthy mining engineer,--> from Hagen-Hohenlimburg|Hohenlimburg, Germany. Wilhelm Böing emigrated to the United States in 1868 and initially worked as a laborer. His move to the United States was disliked by his father and he received no financial support. He later made a fortune from Laurentian Mixed Forest Province|North Woods timber lands and iron ore mineral rights on the Mesabi Range of Minnesota, north of Lake Superior. In 1890, when William was eight, his father died of influenza and his mother soon moved to Europe. Marie enrolled William Jr. and his sister at Schools in Switzerland.  He attended school in Vevey, Switzerland, and returned to the US for a year of prep school at St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire nearer Boston. William Boeing's mother remarried in 1898 and moved to Virginia. He enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut,From the PBS documentary "Pioneers in Aviation: The Race for the Moon Episode I; The Early Years" dropping out in 1903 to go into the lumber business. ==Career== Boeing moved to Hoquiam, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest.  He was successful in the venture, in part by shipping lumber to the East Coast via the then-new Panama Canal, generating funds that he would later apply to a very different business., BBC Mundo, July 4, 2016 While president of Greenwood Timber Company, Boeing, who had experimented with boat design, traveled to Seattle. During the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in 1909, he saw a manned flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with aircraft. In 1910, at the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field|Dominguez Flying Meet, Boeing asked every pilot foreign and domestic if he could go for an airplane ride and was repeatedly denied except for French aviator Louis Paulhan. Boeing waited and Paulhan finished the meet and left never giving Boeing his ride.; National Aviation Hall of Fame  Boeing took flying lessons at Glenn L. Martin Flying School in Los Angeles and purchased one of Martin's planes.Schefke, Brian.  In "Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present", vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified June 3, 2016. Martin pilot James Floyd Smith traveled to Seattle to assemble Boeing's new Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin TA hydroaeroplane and continue to teach its owner to fly. Huge crates arrived by train and Smith assembled the plane in a tent hangar erected on the shore of Lake Union. Boeing's test pilot, Herb Munter, soon damaged the plane.  When he was told by Martin that replacement parts would not be available for months, Boeing told his friend, Commander George Conrad Westervelt of the US Navy, "We could build a better plane ourselves and build it faster." Westervelt agreed. They soon built and flew the B & W Seaplane, an amphibian biplane that had outstanding performance. Boeing decided to go into the aircraft business, using an old boat works on the Duwamish River near Seattle for his factory. File:Boeing B&W.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Boeing Model 1|B & W Seaplane  In 1916, Boeing went into business with George Conrad Westervelt as "B & W" and founded Pacific Aero Products Co. The company's first plane was the Boeing Model 1 (B & W Seaplane). When America entered the First World War on April 8, 1917, Boeing changed the name to Boeing Airplane Company and obtained orders from the U.S. Navy|US Navy for 50 planes. At the end of the war, Boeing concentrated on commercial aircraft to service airmail contracts.  On March 3, 1919, Willam Boeing partnered with Eddie Hubbard to make the first delivery of international airmail to the United States. They flew a Boeing C-700 seaplane for the demonstration trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Seattle's Lake Union, carrying a bag of 60 letters from the Canadian post office for delivery in the U.S. ==Boeing family== In 1921, Boeing married Bertha Marie Potter Paschall (1891-1977). She had previously been married to Nathaniel Paschall, a real estate broker with whom she had two sons, Nathaniel "Nat" Paschall Jr. and Cranston Paschall. The couple had a son of their own, William E. Boeing Jr. (1922–2015). The stepsons went into aviation manufacturing as a career. Nat Paschall was a sales manager for competitor Douglas Aircraft, which later became McDonnell Douglas. Bill Jr. became a private pilot and industrial real estate developer. Bertha Boeing was the daughter of Howard Cranston Potter and Alice Kershaw Potter. Through her father, she was a descendant of the founders of Alex. Brown & Sons merchant bankers Alexander Brown, James Brown, and Brown's son-in-law and partner Howard Potter; and through her mother, the granddaughter of Charles James Kershaw and Mary Leavenworth Kershaw (a descendant of Henry Leavenworth).

The new grouping was a vertical integration|vertically integrated company with interests in all aspects of aviation, intending to serve all aviation markets. In a short time, it bought a host of small airlines, merging them with Boeing's pioneering airline under a holding company, United Airlines|United Air Lines. In 1934, the United States government accused William Boeing of antitrust|monopolistic practices. The same year, the Air Mail Act forced airplane companies to separate flight operations from development and manufacturing. William Boeing divested himself of ownership as his holding company, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, broke into three separate entities: * United Aircraft Corporation, holding the former eastern US manufacturing (later United Technologies Corporation) * Boeing Airplane Company, with western US manufacturing, which later became The Boeing Company * United Airlines|United Air Lines for flight operations He began investing most of his time in his horses in 1937. Boeing Airplane Company, though a major manufacturer in a fragmented industry, did not become successful until the beginning of World War II. ==Later life== File:Portrait, Boeing, William E.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Portrait of Boeing Between 1935 and 1944, William Boeing and his wife Bertha set aside a large tract of land north of the Seattle city limits for subdivision, including the future communities of Richmond Beach, Richmond Heights, Innis Arden, Blue Ridge, and Shoreview. The Boeings placed racially restrictive covenants on their land to enforce segregation, forbidding properties from being "sold, conveyed, rented, or leased in whole or in part to any person not of the White or Caucasian race." Non-whites could only occupy a property on the land if they were employed as a domestic servant "by a person of the White or Caucasian race." He spent the remainder of his life in property development and thoroughbred horse breeding. Concerned about the possibility of World War II battles in the Pacific Northwest, he purchased a  farm in the countryside east of Seattle, which he dubbed "Aldarra." The estate remained in the family until most of the land was developed into a golf course residential community in 2001. Several acres, however, remained in the family, including the Boeing's own and two smaller houses. His primary residence for most of his life, however, was a mansion in The Highlands (Seattle)|The Highlands community close to Seattle; the William E. Boeing House was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boeing Creek running near this property bears his name. On May 14, 1954, William Boeing and his wife Bertha went back to the Boeing Airplane Company to participate in the rollout ceremony for the Boeing 367-80 prototype. William Boeing died on September 28, 1956, at the age of 74, three days before his 75th birthday. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Seattle Yacht Club, having had a myocardial infarction|heart attack aboard his yacht, "Taconite", in Puget Sound, Washington (state)|Washington. His ashes were scattered off the coast of British Columbia, where he spent much of his time sailing. He was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1966. In 1984, Boeing was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.
