 }} "OpenDX" stands for "Open Data Explorer" and is IBM's Scientific visualization|scientific data visualization software. <!-- OpenDX is a visualization (graphic)|visualization program for complex data. Complex meaning more than one dimension. --> It can handle complex domains (such as a mechanical gear or a human brain) along with measurement|measured or computer simulation|computed data. The data may be Scalar field|scalar (such as the concentration of a chemical agent in the brain), vector field|vector or tensor field|tensor fields (like the displacement or strain tensor fields when the gear is in action) at different points of the object. The points at which data is measured don't have to be equally spaced and not need to be homogeneously spaced. The project started in 1991 as "Visualization Data Explorer". <!-- Many Computer program|programs make nice information graphic|graphs of a function (mathematics)|function like <math>y=f(x)</math>, or represent discrete points data <math>(x_i,y_i)</math> as a curve. OpenDx is oriented to more complex data is more complex data as a set of surface heights as a function of positions <math>z=f(x,y)</math> or arrays like <math>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</math>. --> "OpenDX" can produce 3D images with the quantities plotted as color or gray-scale coded, or as vector graphics|vectors, Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines and ribbons. It allows the object to be sliced to obtain a view of the internal structure, and then represent the data on this slice plane as a height-coded graph. It can rotate the object to provide a view of the data from any angle and allows Computer animation|animations of this motion to be made. == Graphical user interface == "OpenDX" is based on the Motif (software)|Motif widget toolkit on top of the X Window System. Its graphical user interface has a wide variety of InterActor|interactors, both direct and indirect. Direct interactors allow the user to directly manipulate images (e.g. rotate or Page zooming|zoom). Indirect interactors (Rotary dial|dials, Switch statement|switches, Button (computing)|buttons, sliders) enable the user to control various aspects of her visualization. Interactors are "smarter" because they are data-driven. Interactors are auto-ranging and self-limiting. They examine the data and, depending on its type, will determine the minimum and maximum of the data, or create a list for an option menu (computing)|menu based on the data. The user can even set the label of the interactor based on some aspect of the data (e.g., Metadata (computing)|metadata).

It also applies to vector interactors. These reconfigure themselves based on the dimensionality of the data. They also auto-range themselves based on the maximum and minimum of each vector component. == Design == Data Explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data. In general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage process: * Describing and importing data * Processing the data through a visualization program * Presenting the resulting image. The principal components of "OpenDX" are ; Data model: This is the set of definitions, rules, and conventions used to describe Data Explorer entities (including data fields, geometrical objects, and images). ; Data Prompter: A user interface for describing data to be imported into Data Explorer. ; Data Browser: A user interface for viewing a data file, determining the layout and organization of the data it contains, and transferring this information to the Data Prompter. ; Scripting Language: A high-level language for creating visualization programs. It can also be used directly in a command mode to perform various tasks. Visual programs—i.e., the visualization programs displayed in the Visual Program Editor window as "networks" of module icons—are also written in the scripting language. A visual program constructed in this window by the user is translated into the same language when it is saved to disk. ; Visual Program Editor (VPE): A graphical user interface for creating and modifying visual programs (networks). Programs created with this editor are translated into the scripting language by Data Explorer and are stored in that form. ; Modules: The "building blocks" (visualization "tools") that constitute a visual program network. They can be directly accessed and manipulated in the "Visual Program Editor". ; Module Builder: A user interface for creating customized modules to be used in visual programs. ; Image Window: An interactive window for viewing and modifying the presentation of the image produced by a visual program. ; Control Panels: A user interface for changing the parameter values used by a visual program. == Screen shots ==  File:opendx-screenshot2.jpg|frame|none|OpenDX screen-shot showing visualization of a scalar field. In this example we show the visualization of the flow of a particulated material (dust) inside a building. In this case the quantity visualized is a scalar, namely the concentration of the particles. The concentration of particles at each point in space is represented using colors. The reader can deduce the concentration by comparing the colors with the "colorbar" at the right upper corner of the image. To improve the visualization the drawing is shadowed as if it had an elevation in the direction normal to the plane proportional to the concentration. In "OpenDX" this is called the "rubber-sheet" effect.  {| | File:opendx-cubcav1.jpg|300px  | File:opendx-cubcav2.jpg|300px  |-  | File:opendx-cubcav3.jpg|300px  | File:opendx-cubcav4.jpg|300px  |} Vector fields are harder to visualize than scalar ones. Consider in this case the flow in a cubic cavity (the 3D version of the well studied  benchmark. The use of Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines helps in realizing the direction of the flow. The "rockets" (the big red arrows on the top of the cavity) represent the imposed flow. <!-- To be short, OpenDX is one of the best visualisation programs out there, and it is free ! Twenty years ago, when IBM made the program, there were big computer centers on campuses and research centers who could afford to buy the product for a lot of money. Then PCs became available and powerful, capable of running such a heavy program ; IBM on the other judged probably that the cost of maintenance of the program was higher than the revenue from it, and decided to opensource it.  The program was made by engineers for engineers, so it will seem a little heavy at the beginning. If however, you have complex data on a regular basis, it is definitively a good choice. --> ==External links== * (out-of-date) * (out-of-date) * for reading HDF5 files Category:Data visualization software Category:Free software programmed in C Category:IBM software|OpenDX
