Although modern historians tend to deny this report on his reign, because other chronicles do not list him among the Hungarian rulers, there is consensus that even if Zoltán never ascended the throne, all monarchs ruling in Hungary from the House of Árpád after around 955 were descended from him. ==Life==  Modern historians' main source of Zoltán's life is the "Gesta Hungarorum", a late 12th-century chronicle whose writer is now known as Anonymus (notary of Béla III)|Anonymus. According to this source, Zoltán was the only son of Árpád, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. In contrast, the nearly contemporary Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus writes that "Zaltas""Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio" (ch. 40), p. 179. was Árpád's fourth son. Zoltán's name seemingly derived from the Arabian language|Arabian sultan title with Turkic languages|Turkic mediation, but modern scholars have not unanimously accepted this etymology. According to Anonymus, Zoltán was born after 903, during his father's second campaign against Menumorut. The latter was one of the many local rulers who are solely mentioned in the "Gesta Hungarorum" among the opponents of the Hungarians during Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|their conquest of the Carpathian Basin. In the "Gesta Hungarorum" narration, Menumorut was forced to surrender and to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán in 904 or 905. When Menumorut died, Zoltán inherited his father-in-law's duchy east of the river Tisza, which Anonymus claims was inhabited by "the peoples that are called Khazar|Kozár"."Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians" (ch. 11), p. 33. Anonymus also states that Zoltán, still a minor, succeeded his father who died around 907. Zoltán, in turn, later abdicated in favour of his son Taksony of Hungary|Taksony and died "in the third year of his son's reign"."Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians" (ch. 57), p. 127.   Nowadays historians reject most details of Zoltán's life presented by Anonymus. For instance, the Hungarian historian Gyula Kristó says that Zoltán was born around 880 instead of around 903. His Romanian colleague Alexandru Madgearu likewise writes that either Zoltán was born many years earlier than 903 or his marriage must have happened years after 904. Zoltán's father-in-law's identity is also debated. Medievalist Pál Engel says that Menumorut is one of the "imaginary figures" invented by Anonymus in order to describe the conquering Hungarians' heroic wars against them. Historian Charles R. Bowlus writes that he was a Moravian ruler whose daughter's marriage with Zoltán symbolized the end of "Great Moravia". Medievalist Tudor Sălăgean also says that Menumorut was a real person, the ruler of a one-time duchy inhabited by Romanians, Slavs and many other peoples at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. Anonymus's statement that Zoltán succeeded his father as grand prince, or even the idea that Zoltán ever ruled the federation of the Hungarian tribes have also been challenged. For instance, historian Sándor L. Tóth writes that Zoltán, being the youngest among Árpád's four sons, could hardly precede his elder brothers in the line of succession. Kristó also says that other Hungarian chroniclers do not make mention of Zoltán's rule, implying that Anonymus only inserted Zoltán into the incompletely preserved list of the grand princes because he knew that all Hungarian monarchs from the House of Árpád descended from him. ==Family== The following is a family tree presenting Zoltán's closest-known relatives:            "*Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars."<br />"**All later Grand Prince of the Hungarians|grand princes and kings of Hungary (until 1301) descended from Taksony." ==See also== *Principality of Hungary ==References==  ==Sources==   *"Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians" (Edited, Translated and Annotated by Martyn Rady and László Veszprémy) (2010).
