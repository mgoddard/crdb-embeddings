   This page walks you through deploying an application and database in
   multiple regions. It is the fifth and final section of the Develop and
   Deploy a Multi-Region Web Application tutorial.

   Tip:

   For a live demo of the deployed MovR Flask application, see
   https://movr.cloud.

Before you begin

   Before you begin this section, complete the previous section of the
   tutorial, Develop a Multi-Region Web Application. After you finish
   developing and debugging your multi-region application in a local
   development environment, you are ready to deploy the application and
   database in multiple regions.

   In addition to the requirements listed in Setting Up a Virtual Environment
   for Developing Multi-Region Applications, make sure that you have the
   following installed on your local machine:

     * Google Cloud SDK
     * Docker
     * kubectl

Multi-region database deployment

   In production, you want to start a secure CockroachDB cluster, with nodes
   on machines located in different areas of the world. To deploy CockroachDB
   in multiple regions, using CockroachCloud:

    1. Create a CockroachCloud account at https://cockroachlabs.cloud.

    2. Request a multi-region CockroachCloud cluster on GCP, in regions
       us-west1, us-east1, and europe-west1.

    3. After the cluster is created, open the console, and select the
       cluster.

    4. Select SQL Users from the side panel, select Add user, give the user a
       name and a password, and then add the user. You can use any user name
       except "root".

    5. Select Networking from the side panel, and then select Add network.
       Give the network any name you'd like, select either a New network or a
       Public network, check both UI and SQL, and then add the network. In
       this example, we use a public network.

    6. Select Connect at the top-right corner of the cluster console.

    7. Select the User that you created, and then Continue.

    8. Copy the connection string, with the user and password specified.

    9. Go back, and retrieve the connection strings for the other two
       regions.

   10. Download the cluster cert to your local machine (it's the same for all
       regions).

   11. Open a new terminal, and run the dbinit.sql file on the running
       cluster to initialize the database. You can connect to the database
       from any node on the cluster for this step.

       copy

 $ cockroach sql --url any-connection-string < dbinit.sql

       Note:

       You need to specify the password in the connection string!

       e.g.,

 $ cockroach sql --url \ 'postgresql://user:password@region.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=certs-dir/movr-app-ca.crt' < dbinit.sql

   Note:

   You can also deploy CRDB manually. For instructions, see the Manual
   Deployment page of the Cockroach Labs documentation site.

Multi-region application deployment (GKE)

   To deploy an application in multiple regions in production, we recommend
   that you use a managed Kubernetes engine, like Amazon EKS, Google
   Kubernetes Engine, or Azure Kubernetes Service. To route requests to the
   container cluster deployed closest to clients, you should also set up a
   multi-cluster ingress.

   In this tutorial, we use kubemci to configure a GCP HTTP Load Balancer to
   container clusters deployed on GKE.

   Note:

   To serve a secure web application, you also need a public domain name!

    1. If you don't have a gcloud account, create one at
       https://cloud.google.com/.

    2. Create a gcloud project on the GCP console.

    3. Optional: Enable the Google Maps Embed API, create an API key,
       restrict the API key to all subdomains of your domain name (e.g.
       https://site.com/*), and retrieve the API key.

       Note:

       The example HTML templates include maps. Not providing an API key to
       the application will not break the application.

    4. Configure/authorize the gcloud CLI to use your project and region.

       copy

 $ gcloud init

       copy

 $ gcloud auth login

       copy

 $ gcloud auth application-default login

    5. If you haven't already, install kubectl.

       copy

 $ gcloud components install kubectl

    6. Build and run the Docker image locally.

       copy

 $ docker build -t gcr.io/<gcp_project>/movr-app:v1 .

       If there are no errors, the container built successfully.

    7. Push the Docker image to the project’s gcloud container registry.

       copy

 $ docker push gcr.io/<gcp_project>/movr-app:v1

    8. Create a K8s cluster for all three regions.

       copy

 $ gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b && \
   gcloud container clusters create movr-us-east

       copy

 $ gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b && \
   gcloud container clusters create movr-us-west

       copy

 $ gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b && \
   gcloud container clusters create movr-europe-west

    9. Add the container credentials to kubeconfig.

       copy

 $ KUBECONFIG=~/mcikubeconfig gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone=us-east1-b movr-us-east

       copy

 $ KUBECONFIG=~/mcikubeconfig gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone=us-west1-b movr-us-west

       copy

 $ KUBECONFIG=~/mcikubeconfig gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone=europe-west1-b movr-europe-west

   10. For each cluster context, create a secret for the connection string,
       Google Maps API, and the certs, and then create the k8s deployment and
       service using the movr.yaml manifest file:

       copy

 $ kubectl config use-context <context-name> && \
 kubectl create secret generic movr-db-cert --from-file=cert=<full-path-to-cert> && \
 kubectl create secret generic movr-db-uri --from-literal=DB_URI="connection-string" && \
 kubectl create secret generic maps-api-key --from-literal=API_KEY="APIkey" \
 kubectl create -f ~/movr-flask/movr.yaml

       Where:
          * <context-name> is the cluster context for a regional deployment.
            To get the contexts for all deployments, run $ kubectl config
            get-contexts -o name.
          * <full-path-to-cert> is the full directory path to the
            certificates for the multi-region CockroachCloud cluster. These
            certificates are available for download from the CockroachCloud
            console, and they are the same for all regions.
          * <connection-string> is the full connection string to the gateway
            node of a regional CockroachCloud deployment. It should look
            something like:
            postgresql://user:password@region.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=certs-dir/movr-app-ca.crt
          * <APIkey> is the API key for the Google Maps Embed API. This API
            key is not required to run the demo application. Not providing a
            Google Maps Embed API key will not break the application.

       Note:

       Secrets must be generated for each cluster context.

   11. Reserve a static IP address for the ingress.

       copy

 $ gcloud compute addresses create --global movr-ip

       To verify that you successfully created the new IP address, run the
       following command:

       copy

 $ gcloud compute addresses list

   12. Download kubemci, and then make it executable:

       copy

 $ chmod +x ~/kubemci

   13. Use kubemci to make the ingress.

       copy

 $ ~/kubemci create movr-mci \
 --ingress=<path>/movr-flask/mcingress.yaml \
 --gcp-project=<gcp_project> \
 --kubeconfig=<path>/mcikubeconfig

       Note:

       kubemci requires full paths.

   14. In GCP's Load balancing console (found under Network Services), select
       and edit the load balancer that you just created.

         1. Edit the backend configuration.
               * Expand the advanced configurations, and add a custom header:
                 X-City: {client_city}. This forwards an additional header to
                 the application telling it what city the client is in. The
                 header name (X-City) is hardcoded into the example
                 application.
         2. Edit the frontend configuration, and add a new frontend.
               * Under "Protocol", select HTTPS.
               * Under "IP address", select the static IP address that you
                 reserved earlier (e.g., "movr-ip").
               * Under "Certificate", select "Create a new certificate".
               * On the "Create a new certificate" page, give a name to the
                 certificate (e.g., "movr-ssl-cert"), check "Create
                 Google-managed certificate", and then under "Domains", enter
                 a domain name that you own and want to use for your
                 application.
         3. Review and finalize the load balancer, and then "Update".

            Note:

            It will take several minutes to provision the SSL certificate
            that you just created for the frontend.

   15. Check the status of the ingress.

       copy

 $ ~/kubemci list --gcp-project=<gcp_project>

   16. In the Cloud DNS console (found under Network Services), create a new
       zone. You can name the zone whatever you want. Enter the same domain
       name for which you created a certificate earlier.

   17. Select your zone, and copy the nameserver addresses (under "Data") for
       the recordset labeled "NS".

   18. Outside of the GCP console, through your domain name provider, add the
       nameserver addresses to the authorative nameserver list for your
       domain name.

       Note:

       It can take up to 48 hours for changes to the authorative nameserver
       list to take effect.

   19. Navigate to the domain name and test out your application.

Next steps

  Develop your own application

   This tutorial demonstrates how to develop and deploy an example
   multi-region application. Most of the development instructions are
   specific to Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, and most of the deployment
   instructions are specific to Google Cloud Platform, Docker, and
   Kubernetes. CockroachDB supports many more drivers and ORM's for
   development. You can deploy applications using a number of cloud provider
   orchestration tools and networking services. We encourage you to modify
   the code and deployments to fit your framework and use case.

  Upgrade your deployment

   Some time after you have deployed your application, you will likely need
   to push changes that you've made locally. When pushing changes, be aware
   that you defined the database separate from the application. If you change
   a data type, for example, in your application, you will also need to
   modify the database schema to be compatible with your application's
   requests. For information about making online changes to database schemas,
   see Online Schema Changes.
