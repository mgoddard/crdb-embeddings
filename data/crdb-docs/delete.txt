   The DELETE statement deletes rows from a table.

   Warning:
   If you delete a row that is referenced by a foreign key constraint and has
   an ON DELETE action, all of the dependent rows will also be deleted or
   updated.
   Note:
   To delete columns, see DROP COLUMN.

Required privileges

   The user must have the DELETE and SELECT privileges on the table.

Synopsis

   WITH RECURSIVE common_table_expr , DELETE FROM table_name opt_index_flags
   AS table_alias_name WHERE a_expr sort_clause limit_clause RETURNING
   target_list NOTHING

Parameters

   Parameter           Description                                            
   common_table_expr   See Common Table Expressions.                          
   table_name          The name of the table that contains the rows you want  
                       to update.                                             
   AS table_alias_name An alias for the table name. When an alias is          
                       provided, it completely hides the actual table name.   
                       a_expr must be an expression that returns Boolean      
                       values using columns (e.g., <column> = <value>).       
   WHERE a_expr        Delete rows that return TRUE.                          
                                                                              
                       Without a WHERE clause in your statement, DELETE       
                       removes all rows from the table.                       
                       An ORDER BY clause.                                    
   sort_clause                                                                
                       See [Ordering of rows in                               

   DML statements](query-order.html#ordering-rows-in-dml-statements) for more
   details. limit_clause | A LIMIT clause. See Limiting Query Results for
   more details. RETURNING target_list | Return values based on rows deleted,
   where target_list can be specific column names from the table, * for all
   columns, or computations using scalar expressions.

   To return nothing in the response, not even the number of rows updated,
   use RETURNING NOTHING.

Success responses

   Successful DELETE statements return one of the following:

   Response        Description                                                
                   int rows were deleted.                                     
                                                                              
   DELETE int      DELETE statements that do not delete any rows respond with 
                   DELETE 0. When RETURNING NOTHING is used, this information 
                   is not included in the response.                           
                   Including the RETURNING clause retrieves the deleted rows, 
   Retrieved table using the columns identified by the clause's parameters.   
                                                                              
                   See an example.                                            

Disk space usage after deletes

   Deleting a row does not immediately free up the disk space. This is due to
   the fact that CockroachDB retains the ability to query tables
   historically.

   If disk usage is a concern, the solution is to reduce the time-to-live
   (TTL) for the zone by setting gc.ttlseconds to a lower value, which will
   cause garbage collection to clean up deleted objects (rows, tables) more
   frequently.

Select performance on deleted rows

   Queries that scan across tables that have lots of deleted rows will have
   to scan over deletions that have not yet been garbage collected. Certain
   database usage patterns that frequently scan over and delete lots of rows
   will want to reduce the time-to-live values to clean up deleted rows more
   frequently.

Sorting the output of deletes

   To sort the output of a DELETE statement, use:

   copy

 > WITH a AS (DELETE ... RETURNING ...)
   SELECT ... FROM a ORDER BY ...

   For an example, see Sort and return deleted rows.

   For more information about ordering query results in general, see Ordering
   Query Results and Ordering of rows in DML statements.

Delete performance on large data sets

   If you are deleting a large amount of data using iterative DELETE ...
   LIMIT statements, you are likely to see a drop in performance for each
   subsequent DELETE statement.

   For an explanation of why this happens, and for instructions showing how
   to iteratively delete rows in constant time, see Why are my deletes
   getting slower over time?.

Force index selection for deletes

   By using the explicit index annotation (also known as "index hinting"),
   you can override CockroachDB's index selection and use a specific index
   for deleting rows of a named table.

   Note:

   Index selection can impact performance, but does not change the result of
   a query.

   The syntax to force a specific index for a delete is:

   copy

 > DELETE FROM table@my_idx;

   This is equivalent to the longer expression:

   copy

 > DELETE FROM table@{FORCE_INDEX=my_idx};

   To view how the index hint modifies the query plan that CockroachDB
   follows for deleting rows, use an EXPLAIN statement. To see all indexes
   available on a table, use SHOW INDEXES.

   For examples, see Delete with index hints.

Examples

  Setup

   The following examples use MovR, a fictional vehicle-sharing application,
   to demonstrate CockroachDB SQL statements. For more information about the
   MovR example application and dataset, see MovR: A Global Vehicle-sharing
   App.

   To follow along, run cockroach demo to start a temporary, in-memory
   cluster with the movr dataset preloaded:

   copy

 $ cockroach demo

  Delete all rows

   You can delete all rows from a table by not including a WHERE clause in
   your DELETE statement.

   Note:

   If the sql_safe_updates session variable is set to true, the client will
   prevent the update. sql_safe_updates is set to true by default.

   copy

 > DELETE FROM vehicle_location_histories;

 pq: rejected: DELETE without WHERE clause (sql_safe_updates = true)

   You can use a SET statement to set session variables.

   copy

 > SET sql_safe_updates = false;

   copy

 > DELETE FROM vehicle_location_histories;

 DELETE 1000

   Tip:

   Unless your table is small (less than 1000 rows), using TRUNCATE to delete
   the contents of a table will be more performant than using DELETE.

  Delete specific rows

   When deleting specific rows from a table, the most important decision you
   make is which columns to use in your WHERE clause. When making that
   choice, consider the potential impact of using columns with the Primary
   Key/Unique constraints (both of which enforce uniqueness) versus those
   that are not unique.

    Delete rows using Primary Key/unique columns

   Using columns with the Primary Key or Unique constraints to delete rows
   ensures your statement is unambiguous—no two rows contain the same column
   value, so it's less likely to delete data unintentionally.

   In this example, code is our primary key and we want to delete the row
   where the code equals "about_stuff_city". Because we're positive no other
   rows have that value in the code column, there's no risk of accidentally
   removing another row.

   copy

 > DELETE FROM promo_codes WHERE code = 'about_stuff_city';

 DELETE 1

    Delete rows using non-unique columns

   Deleting rows using non-unique columns removes every row that returns TRUE
   for the WHERE clause's a_expr. This can easily result in deleting data you
   didn't intend to.

   copy

 > DELETE FROM promo_codes WHERE creation_time > '2019-01-30 00:00:00+00:00';

 DELETE 4

   The example statement deleted four rows, which might be unexpected.

  Return deleted rows

   To see which rows your statement deleted, include the RETURNING clause to
   retrieve them using the columns you specify.

    Use all columns

   By specifying *, you retrieve all columns of the delete rows.

    Use specific columns

   To retrieve specific columns, name them in the RETURNING clause.

   copy

 > DELETE FROM promo_codes WHERE creation_time > '2019-01-29 00:00:00+00:00' RETURNING code, rules;

            code          |                    rules
 +------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
   box_investment_stuff   | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
   energy_newspaper_field | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
   simple_guy_theory      | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
   study_piece_war        | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
   tv_this_list           | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
 (5 rows)


    Change column labels

   When RETURNING specific columns, you can change their labels using AS.

   copy

 > DELETE FROM promo_codes WHERE creation_time > '2019-01-28 00:00:00+00:00' RETURNING code, rules AS discount;

          code         |                   discount
 +---------------------+----------------------------------------------+
   chair_company_state | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
   view_reveal_radio   | {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "10%"}
 (2 rows)

    Sort and return deleted rows

   To sort and return deleted rows, use a statement like the following:

   copy

 > WITH a AS (DELETE FROM promo_codes WHERE creation_time > '2019-01-27 00:00:00+00:00' RETURNING *)
   SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY expiration_time;

              code            |                                                                                                  description                                                                                                   |       creation_time       |      expiration_time      |                    rules

  Delete with index hints

   Suppose you create a multi-column index on the users table with the name
   and city columns.

   copy

 > CREATE INDEX ON users (name, city);

   Now suppose you want to delete the two users named "Jon Snow". You can use
   the EXPLAIN (OPT) command to see how the cost-based optimizer decides to
   perform the delete:

   copy

 > EXPLAIN (OPT) DELETE FROM users WHERE name='Jon Snow';

                                      text
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        └── id = user_id
 (22 rows)

   The output of the EXPLAIN statement shows that the optimizer scans the
   newly-created users_name_city_idx index when performing the delete. This
   makes sense, as you are performing a delete based on the name column.

   Now suppose that instead you want to perform a delete, but using the id
   column instead.

   copy

 > EXPLAIN (OPT) DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN ('70a3d70a-3d70-4400-8000-000000000016', '3d70a3d7-0a3d-4000-8000-00000000000c');

   The optimizer still scans the newly-created users_name_city_idx index when
   performing the delete. Although scanning the table on this index could
   still be the most efficient, you may want to assess the performance
   difference between using users_name_city_idx and an index on the id
   column, as you are performing a delete with a filter on the id column.

   If you provide an index hint (i.e. force the index selection) to use the
   primary index on the column instead, the CockroachDB will scan the users
   table using the primary index, on city, and id.

   copy

 > EXPLAIN (OPT) DELETE FROM users@primary WHERE id IN ('70a3d70a-3d70-4400-8000-000000000016', '3d70a3d7-0a3d-4000-8000-00000000000c');
