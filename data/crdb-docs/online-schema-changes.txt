   CockroachDB's online schema changes provide a simple way to update a table
   schema without imposing any negative consequences on an application —
   including downtime. The schema change engine is a built-in feature
   requiring no additional tools, resources, or ad hoc sequencing of
   operations.

   Benefits of online schema changes include:

     * Changes to your table schema happen while the database is running.
     * The schema change runs as a background job without holding locks on
       the underlying table data.
     * Your application's queries can run normally, with no effect on
       read/write latency. The schema is cached for performance.
     * Your data is kept in a safe, consistent state throughout the entire
       schema change process.
   Warning:

   Schema changes consume additional resources, and if they are run when the
   cluster is near peak capacity, latency spikes can occur. This is
   especially true for any schema change that adds columns, drops columns, or
   adds an index. We do not recommend doing more than one schema change at a
   time while in production.

   Tip:

   Support for schema changes within transactions is limited. We recommend
   doing schema changes outside transactions where possible. When a schema
   management tool uses transactions on your behalf, we recommend only doing
   one schema change operation per transaction.

   Note:

   You cannot start an online schema change on a table if a primary key
   change is currently in progress on the same table.

How online schema changes work

   At a high level, online schema changes are accomplished by using a
   bridging strategy involving concurrent uses of multiple versions of the
   schema. The process is as follows:

    1. A user initiates a schema change by executing ALTER TABLE, CREATE
       INDEX, TRUNCATE, etc.

    2. The schema change engine converts the original schema to the new
       schema in discrete steps while ensuring that the underlying table data
       is always in a consistent state. These changes are executed as a
       background job, and can be paused, resumed, and canceled.

   This approach allows the schema change engine to roll out a new schema
   while the previous version is still in use. It then backfills or deletes
   the underlying table data as needed in the background, while the cluster
   is still running and servicing reads and writes from your application.

   During the backfilling process, the schema change engine updates the
   underlying table data to make sure all instances of the table are stored
   according to the requirements of the new schema.

   Once backfilling is complete, all nodes will switch over to the new
   schema, and will allow reads and writes of the table using the new schema.

   For more technical details, see How online schema changes are possible in
   CockroachDB.

   Note:

   If a schema change fails, the schema change job will be cleaned up
   automatically. However, there are limitations with rolling back schema
   changes within a transaction; for more information, see below.

Examples

   Tip:

   For more examples of schema change statements, see the ALTER TABLE
   subcommands.

  Run schema changes inside a transaction with CREATE TABLE

   As noted in Limitations, you cannot run schema changes inside transactions
   in general.

   However, as of version v2.1, you can run schema changes inside the same
   transaction as a CREATE TABLE statement. For example:

   copy

 > BEGIN;
   SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   CREATE TABLE fruits (
         id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
         name STRING,
         color STRING
     );
   INSERT INTO fruits (name, color) VALUES ('apple', 'red');
   ALTER TABLE fruits ADD COLUMN inventory_count INTEGER DEFAULT 5;
   ALTER TABLE fruits ADD CONSTRAINT name CHECK (name IN ('apple', 'banana', 'orange'));
   SELECT name, color, inventory_count FROM fruits;
   RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   COMMIT;

   The transaction succeeds with the following output:

 BEGIN
 SAVEPOINT
 CREATE TABLE
 INSERT 0 1
 ALTER TABLE
 ALTER TABLE
 +-------+-------+-----------------+
 | name  | color | inventory_count |
 +-------+-------+-----------------+
 | apple | red   |               5 |
 +-------+-------+-----------------+
 (1 row)
 COMMIT
 COMMIT

  Run multiple schema changes in a single ALTER TABLE statement

   As of v19.1, some schema changes can be used in combination in a single
   ALTER TABLE statement. For a list of commands that can be combined, see
   ALTER TABLE. For a demonstration, see Add and rename columns atomically.

  Show all schema change jobs

   You can check on the status of the schema change jobs on your system at
   any time using the SHOW JOBS statement:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE job_type = 'SCHEMA CHANGE';

 +--------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------+-------+----------------+

   All schema change jobs can be paused, resumed, and canceled.

Limitations

  Overview

   Schema changes keep your data consistent at all times, but they do not run
   inside transactions in the general case. This is necessary so the cluster
   can remain online and continue to service application reads and writes.

   Specifically, this behavior is necessary because making schema changes
   transactional would mean requiring a given schema change to propagate
   across all the nodes of a cluster. This would block all user-initiated
   transactions being run by your application, since the schema change would
   have to commit before any other transactions could make progress. This
   would prevent the cluster from servicing reads and writes during the
   schema change, requiring application downtime.

  Limited support for schema changes within transactions

   Within a single transaction:

     * DDL statements cannot be mixed with DML statements. As a workaround,
       you can split the statements into separate transactions. For more
       details, see examples of unsupported statements.
     * As of version v2.1, you can run schema changes inside the same
       transaction as a CREATE TABLE statement. For more information, see
       this example.
     * A CREATE TABLE statement containing FOREIGN KEY or INTERLEAVE clauses
       cannot be followed by statements that reference the new table.
     * A table cannot be dropped and then recreated with the same name. This
       is not possible within a single transaction because DROP TABLE does
       not immediately drop the name of the table. As a workaround, split the
       DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements into separate transactions.
     * Schema change DDL statements inside a multi-statement transaction can
       fail while other statements succeed.
     * As of v19.1, some schema changes can be used in combination in a
       single ALTER TABLE statement. For a list of commands that can be
       combined, see ALTER TABLE. For a demonstration, see Add and rename
       columns atomically.
   Note:

   If a schema change within a transaction fails, manual intervention may be
   needed to determine which has failed. After determining which schema
   change(s) failed, you can then retry the schema changes.

  Schema change DDL statements inside a multi-statement transaction can fail
  while other statements succeed

   Schema change DDL statements that run inside a multi-statement transaction
   with non-DDL statements can fail at COMMIT time, even if other statements
   in the transaction succeed. This leaves such transactions in a "partially
   committed, partially aborted" state that may require manual intervention
   to determine whether the DDL statements succeeded.

   If such a failure occurs, CockroachDB will emit a new CockroachDB-specific
   error code, XXA00, and the following error message:

 transaction committed but schema change aborted with error: <description of error>
 HINT: Some of the non-DDL statements may have committed successfully, but some of the DDL statement(s) failed.
 Manual inspection may be required to determine the actual state of the database.

   Note:

   This limitation exists in versions of CockroachDB prior to 19.2. In these
   older versions, CockroachDB returned the Postgres error code 40003,
   "statement completion unknown".

   Warning:

   If you must execute schema change DDL statements inside a multi-statement
   transaction, we strongly recommend checking for this error code and
   handling it appropriately every time you execute such transactions.

   This error will occur in various scenarios, including but not limited to:

     * Creating a unique index fails because values aren't unique.
     * The evaluation of a computed value fails.
     * Adding a constraint (or a column with a constraint) fails because the
       constraint is violated for the default/computed values in the column.

   To see an example of this error, start by creating the following table.

   copy

 CREATE TABLE T(x INT);
 INSERT INTO T(x) VALUES (1), (2), (3);

   Then, enter the following multi-statement transaction, which will trigger
   the error.

   copy

 BEGIN;
 ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT unique_x UNIQUE(x);
 INSERT INTO T(x) VALUES (3);
 COMMIT;

 pq: transaction committed but schema change aborted with error: (23505): duplicate key value (x)=(3) violates unique constraint "unique_x"
 HINT: Some of the non-DDL statements may have committed successfully, but some of the DDL statement(s) failed.
 Manual inspection may be required to determine the actual state of the database.

   In this example, the INSERT statement committed, but the ALTER TABLE
   statement adding a UNIQUE constraint failed. We can verify this by looking
   at the data in table t and seeing that the additional non-unique value 3
   was successfully inserted.

   copy

 SELECT * FROM t;

   x
 +---+
   1
   2
   3
   3
 (4 rows)

  No schema changes between executions of prepared statements

   When the schema of a table targeted by a prepared statement changes before
   the prepared statement is executed, CockroachDB allows the prepared
   statement to return results based on the changed table schema, for
   example:

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY);

   copy

 > PREPARE prep1 AS SELECT * FROM users;

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN name STRING;

   copy

 > INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Max Roach');

   copy

 > EXECUTE prep1;

 +----+-----------+
 | id |   name    |
 +----+-----------+
 |  1 | Max Roach |
 +----+-----------+
 (1 row)

   It's therefore recommended to not use SELECT * in queries that will be
   repeated, via prepared statements or otherwise.

   Also, a prepared INSERT, UPSERT, or DELETE statement acts inconsistently
   when the schema of the table being written to is changed before the
   prepared statement is executed:

     * If the number of columns has increased, the prepared statement returns
       an error but nonetheless writes the data.
     * If the number of columns remains the same but the types have changed,
       the prepared statement writes the data and does not return an error.

  Examples of statements that fail

   The following statements fail due to limited support for schema changes
   within transactions.

    Create an index and then run a select against that index inside a
    transaction

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE foo (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR);
   BEGIN;
   SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   CREATE INDEX foo_idx ON foo (id, name);
   SELECT * from foo@foo_idx;
   RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   COMMIT;

 CREATE TABLE
 BEGIN
 SAVEPOINT
 CREATE INDEX
 ERROR:  relation "foo_idx" does not exist
 ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
 ROLLBACK

    Add a column and then add a constraint against that column inside a
    transaction

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE foo ();
   BEGIN;
   SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN bar VARCHAR;
   ALTER TABLE foo ADD CONSTRAINT bar CHECK (foo IN ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'));
   RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   COMMIT;

 CREATE TABLE
 BEGIN
 SAVEPOINT
 ALTER TABLE
 ERROR:  column "foo" not found for constraint "foo"
 ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
 ROLLBACK

    Add a column and then select against that column inside a transaction

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE foo ();
   BEGIN;
   SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN bar VARCHAR;
   SELECT bar FROM foo;
   RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;
   COMMIT;

 CREATE TABLE
 BEGIN
 SAVEPOINT
 ALTER TABLE
 ERROR:  column name "bar" not found
 ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
 ROLLBACK
