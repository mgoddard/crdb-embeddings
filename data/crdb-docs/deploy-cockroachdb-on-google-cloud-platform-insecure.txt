   Secure Insecure

   This page shows you how to manually deploy an insecure multi-node
   CockroachDB cluster on Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine (GCE), using
   Google's TCP Proxy Load Balancing service to distribute client traffic.

   Warning:
   If you plan to use CockroachDB in production, we strongly recommend using
   a secure cluster instead. Select Secure above for instructions.

Before you begin

  Requirements

     * You must have SSH access to each machine. This is necessary for
       distributing and starting CockroachDB binaries.

     * Your network configuration must allow TCP communication on the
       following ports:

          * 26257 for intra-cluster and client-cluster communication
          * 8080 to expose your Admin UI
     * Carefully review the Production Checklist and recommended Topology
       Patterns.

     * Run each node on a separate machine. Since CockroachDB replicates
       across nodes, running more than one node per machine increases the
       risk of data loss if a machine fails. Likewise, if a machine has
       multiple disks or SSDs, run one node with multiple --store flags and
       not one node per disk. For more details about stores, see Start a
       Node.

     * When starting each node, use the --locality flag to describe the
       node's location, for example, --locality=region=west,zone=us-west-1.
       The key-value pairs should be ordered from most to least inclusive,
       and the keys and order of key-value pairs must be the same on all
       nodes.

     * When deploying in a single availability zone:

          * To be able to tolerate the failure of any 1 node, use at least 3
            nodes with the default 3-way replication factor. In this case, if
            1 node fails, each range retains 2 of its 3 replicas, a majority.
          * To be able to tolerate 2 simultaneous node failures, use at least
            5 nodes and increase the default replication factor for user data
            to 5. The replication factor for important internal data is 5 by
            default, so no adjustments are needed for internal data. In this
            case, if 2 nodes fail at the same time, each range retains 3 of
            its 5 replicas, a majority.
     * When deploying across multiple availability zones:

          * To be able to tolerate the failure of 1 entire AZ in a region,
            use at least 3 AZs per region and set --locality on each node to
            spread data evenly across regions and AZs. In this case, if 1 AZ
            goes offline, the 2 remaining AZs retain a majority of replicas.
          * To be able to tolerate the failure of 1 entire region, use at
            least 3 regions.
     * This article covers the use of Linux instances with GCE. You may wish
       to review the instructions for connecting to Windows instances.

  Recommendations

     * Consider using a secure cluster instead. Using an insecure cluster
       comes with risks:

          * Your cluster is open to any client that can access any node's IP
            addresses.
          * Any user, even root, can log in without providing a password.
          * Any user, connecting as root, can read or write any data in your
            cluster.
          * There is no network encryption or authentication, and thus no
            confidentiality.
     * Decide how you want to access your Admin UI:

       Access Level      Description                                          
       Partially open    Set a firewall rule to allow only specific IP        
                         addresses to communicate on port 8080.               
       Completely open   Set a firewall rule to allow all IP addresses to     
                         communicate on port 8080.                            
                         Set a firewall rule to disallow all communication on 
       Completely closed port 8080. In this case, a machine with SSH access   
                         to a node could use an SSH tunnel to access the      
                         Admin UI.                                            

Step 1. Configure your network

   CockroachDB requires TCP communication on two ports:

     * 26257 for inter-node communication (i.e., working as a cluster)
     * 8080 for exposing your Admin UI

   To expose your Admin UI and allow traffic from the TCP proxy load balancer
   and health checker to your instances, create firewall rules for your
   project. When creating firewall rules, we recommend using Google Cloud
   Platform's tag feature to apply the rule only to instances with the same
   tag.

    Admin UI

   Field                Recommended Value              
   Name                 cockroachadmin                 
   Source filter        IP ranges                      
   Source IP ranges     Your local network's IP ranges 
   Allowed protocols... tcp:8080                       
   Target tags          cockroachdb                    

    Application data

   Applications will not connect directly to your CockroachDB nodes. Instead,
   they'll connect to GCE's TCP Proxy Load Balancing service, which
   automatically routes traffic to the instances that are closest to the
   user. Because this service is implemented at the edge of the Google Cloud,
   you'll need to create a firewall rule to allow traffic from the load
   balancer and health checker to your instances. This is covered in Step 4.

Step 2. Create instances

   Create an instance for each node you plan to have in your cluster. If you
   plan to run a sample workload against the cluster, create a separate
   instance for that workload.

     * Run at least 3 nodes to ensure survivability.

     * Use n1-standard or n1-highcpu predefined VMs, or custom VMs, with
       Local SSDs or SSD persistent disks. For example, Cockroach Labs has
       used n1-standard-16 (16 vCPUs and 60 GB of RAM per VM, local SSD) for
       internal testing.

     * Do not use f1 or g1 shared-core machines, which limit the load on a
       single core.

     * If you used a tag for your firewall rules, when you create the
       instance, click Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy.
       Under the Networking tab, in the Network tags field, enter
       cockroachdb.

   For more details, see Hardware Recommendations and Cluster Topology.

Step 3. Synchronize clocks

   CockroachDB requires moderate levels of clock synchronization to preserve
   data consistency. For this reason, when a node detects that its clock is
   out of sync with at least half of the other nodes in the cluster by 80% of
   the maximum offset allowed (500ms by default), it spontaneously shuts
   down. This avoids the risk of consistency anomalies, but it's best to
   prevent clocks from drifting too far in the first place by running clock
   synchronization software on each node.

   Compute Engine instances are preconfigured to use NTP, which should keep
   offsets in the single-digit milliseconds. However, Google can’t predict
   how external NTP services, such as pool.ntp.org, will handle the leap
   second. Therefore, you should:

     * Configure each GCE instance to use Google's internal NTP service.
     * If you plan to run a hybrid cluster across GCE and other cloud
       providers or environments, note that all of the nodes must be synced
       to the same time source, or to different sources that implement leap
       second smearing in the same way. See the Production Checklist for
       details.

Step 4. Set up load balancing

   Each CockroachDB node is an equally suitable SQL gateway to your cluster,
   but to ensure client performance and reliability, it's important to use
   load balancing:

     * Performance: Load balancers spread client traffic across nodes. This
       prevents any one node from being overwhelmed by requests and improves
       overall cluster performance (queries per second).

     * Reliability: Load balancers decouple client health from the health of
       a single CockroachDB node. In cases where a node fails, the load
       balancer redirects client traffic to available nodes.

   GCE offers fully-managed TCP Proxy Load Balancing. This service lets you
   use a single IP address for all users around the world, automatically
   routing traffic to the instances that are closest to the user.

   Warning:

   When using TCP Proxy Load Balancing, you cannot use firewall rules to
   control access to the load balancer. If you need such control, consider
   using Network TCP Load Balancing instead, but note that it cannot be used
   across regions. You might also consider using the HAProxy load balancer
   (see the On-Premises tutorial for guidance).

   To use GCE's TCP Proxy Load Balancing service:

    1. For each zone in which you're running an instance, create a distinct
       instance group.
          * To ensure that the load balancer knows where to direct traffic,
            specify a port name mapping, with tcp26257 as the Port name and
            26257 as the Port number.
    2. Add the relevant instances to each instance group.
    3. Configure Proxy Load Balancing.
          * During backend configuration, create a health check, setting the
            Protocol to HTTP, the Port to 8080, and the Request path to path
            /health?ready=1. This health endpoint ensures that load balancers
            do not direct traffic to nodes that are live but not ready to
            receive requests.
               * If you want to maintain long-lived SQL connections that may
                 be idle for more than tens of seconds, increase the backend
                 timeout setting accordingly.
          * During frontend configuration, reserve a static IP address and
            choose a port. Note this address/port combination, as you'll use
            it for all of you client connections.
    4. Create a firewall rule to allow traffic from the load balancer and
       health checker to your instances. This is necessary because TCP Proxy
       Load Balancing is implemented at the edge of the Google Cloud.
          * Be sure to set Source IP ranges to 130.211.0.0/22 and
            35.191.0.0/16 and set Target tags to cockroachdb (not to the
            value specified in the linked instructions).

Step 5. Start nodes

   Note:

   By default, inter-node communication uses the internal IP addresses of
   your GCE instances.

   You can start the nodes manually or automate the process using systemd.

   Manual systemd

   For each initial node of your cluster, complete the following steps:

   Note:

   After completing these steps, nodes will not yet be live. They will
   complete the startup process and join together to form a cluster as soon
   as the cluster is initialized in the next step.

    1. SSH to the machine where you want the node to run.

    2. Download the CockroachDB archive for Linux, and extract the binary:

       copy

 $ wget -qO- https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64.tgz \
 | tar  xvz

    3. Copy the binary into the PATH:

       copy

 $ cp -i cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/

       If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with sudo.

    4. Run the cockroach start command:

       copy

 $ cockroach start \
 --insecure \
 --advertise-addr=<node1 address> \
 --join=<node1 address>,<node2 address>,<node3 address> \
 --cache=.25 \
 --max-sql-memory=.25 \
 --background

       This command primes the node to start, using the following flags:

       Flag             Description                                           
       --insecure       Indicates that the cluster is insecure, with no       
                        network encryption or authentication.                 
                        Specifies the IP address/hostname and port to tell    
                        other nodes to use. The port number can be omitted,   
                        in which case it defaults to 26257.                   
                                                                              
                        This value must route to an IP address the node is    
       --advertise-addr listening on (with --listen-addr unspecified, the     
                        node listens on all IP addresses).                    
                                                                              
                        In some networking scenarios, you may need to use     
                        --advertise-addr and/or --listen-addr differently.    
                        For more details, see Networking.                     
                        Identifies the address of 3-5 of the initial nodes of 
       --join           the cluster. These addresses should match the         
                        addresses that the target nodes are advertising.      
                        Increases the node's cache size to 25% of available   
                        system memory to improve read performance. The        
                        capacity for in-memory SQL processing defaults to 25% 
                        of system memory but can be raised, if necessary, to  
       --cache          increase the number of simultaneous client            
       --max-sql-memory connections allowed by the node as well as the node's 
                        capacity for in-memory processing of rows when using  
                        ORDER BY, GROUP BY, DISTINCT, joins, and window       
                        functions. For more details, see Cache and SQL Memory 
                        Size.                                                 
       --background     Starts the node in the background so you gain control 
                        of the terminal to issue more commands.               

       When deploying across multiple datacenters, or when there is otherwise
       high latency between nodes, it is recommended to set --locality as
       well. It is also required to use certain enterprise features. For more
       details, see Locality.

       For other flags not explicitly set, the command uses default values.
       For example, the node stores data in --store=cockroach-data and binds
       Admin UI HTTP requests to --http-addr=localhost:8080. To set these
       options manually, see Start a Node.

    5. Repeat these steps for each additional node that you want in your
       cluster.

   For each initial node of your cluster, complete the following steps:

   Note:
   After completing these steps, nodes will not yet be live. They will
   complete the startup process and join together to form a cluster as soon
   as the cluster is initialized in the next step.
    1. SSH to the machine where you want the node to run. Ensure you are
       logged in as the root user.

    2. Download the CockroachDB archive for Linux, and extract the binary:

       copy

 $ wget -qO- https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64.tgz \
 | tar  xvz

    3. Copy the binary into the PATH:

       copy

 $ cp -i cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/

       If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with sudo.

    4. Create the Cockroach directory:

       copy

 $ mkdir /var/lib/cockroach

    5. Create a Unix user named cockroach:

       copy

 $ useradd cockroach

    6. Change the ownership of Cockroach directory to the user cockroach:

       copy

 $ chown cockroach /var/lib/cockroach

    7. Download the sample configuration template and save the file in the
       /etc/systemd/system/ directory:

       copy

 $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/v20.2/prod-deployment/insecurecockroachdb.service

       Alternatively, you can create the file yourself and copy the script
       into it:

       copy

 [Unit]
 Description=Cockroach Database cluster node
 Requires=network.target
 [Service]
 Type=notify
 WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/cockroach
 ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cockroach start --insecure --advertise-addr=<node1 address> --join=<node1 address>,<node2 address>,<node3 address> --cache=.25 --max-sql-memory=.25
 TimeoutStopSec=60
 Restart=always
 RestartSec=10
 StandardOutput=syslog
 StandardError=syslog
 SyslogIdentifier=cockroach

 WantedBy=default.target


    8. In the sample configuration template, specify values for the following
       flags:

       Flag             Description                                           
                        Specifies the IP address/hostname and port to tell    
                        other nodes to use. The port number can be omitted,   
                        in which case it defaults to 26257.                   
                                                                              
                        This value must route to an IP address the node is    
       --advertise-addr listening on (with --listen-addr unspecified, the     
                        node listens on all IP addresses).                    
                                                                              
                        In some networking scenarios, you may need to use     
                        --advertise-addr and/or --listen-addr differently.    
                        For more details, see Networking.                     
                        Identifies the address of 3-5 of the initial nodes of 
       --join           the cluster. These addresses should match the         
                        addresses that the target nodes are advertising.      

       When deploying across multiple datacenters, or when there is otherwise
       high latency between nodes, it is recommended to set --locality as
       well. It is also required to use certain enterprise features. For more
       details, see Locality.

       For other flags not explicitly set, the command uses default values.
       For example, the node stores data in --store=cockroach-data and binds
       Admin UI HTTP requests to --http-port=8080. To set these options
       manually, see Start a Node.

    9. Start the CockroachDB cluster:

       copy

 $ systemctl start insecurecockroachdb

   10. Repeat these steps for each additional node that you want in your
       cluster.

   Note:

   systemd handles node restarts in case of node failure. To stop a node
   without systemd restarting it, run systemctl stop insecurecockroachdb

Step 6. Initialize the cluster

   On your local machine, complete the node startup process and have them
   join together as a cluster:

    1. Install CockroachDB on your local machine, if you haven't already.

    2. Run the cockroach init command, with the --host flag set to the
       address of any node:

       copy

 $ cockroach init --insecure --host=<address of any node>

       Each node then prints helpful details to the standard output, such as
       the CockroachDB version, the URL for the admin UI, and the SQL URL for
       clients.

Step 7. Test the cluster

   CockroachDB replicates and distributes data behind-the-scenes and uses a
   Gossip protocol to enable each node to locate data across the cluster.
   Once a cluster is live, any node can be used as a SQL gateway.

   When using a load balancer, you should issue commands directly to the load
   balancer, which then routes traffic to the nodes.

   Use the built-in SQL client locally as follows:

    1. On your local machine, launch the built-in SQL client, with the --host
       flag set to the address of the load balancer:

       copy

 $ cockroach sql --insecure --host=<address of load balancer>

    2. Create an insecurenodetest database:

       copy

 > CREATE DATABASE insecurenodetest;

    3. View the cluster's databases, which will include insecurenodetest:

       copy

 > SHOW DATABASES;

 +--------------------+
 |      Database      |
 +--------------------+
 | crdb_internal      |
 | information_schema |
 | insecurenodetest   |
 | pg_catalog         |
 | system             |
 +--------------------+
 (5 rows)

    4. Use \q to exit the SQL shell.

Step 8. Run a sample workload

   CockroachDB offers a pre-built workload binary for Linux that includes
   several load generators for simulating client traffic against your
   cluster. This step features CockroachDB's version of the TPC-C workload.

   Tip:
   For comprehensive guidance on benchmarking CockroachDB with TPC-C, see our
   Performance Benchmarking white paper.
    1. SSH to the machine where you want the run the sample TPC-C workload.

       This should be a machine that is not running a CockroachDB node.

    2. Download workload and make it executable:

       copy

 $ wget https://edge-binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach/workload.LATEST ; chmod 755 workload.LATEST

    3. Rename and copy workload into the PATH:

       copy

 $ cp -i workload.LATEST /usr/local/bin/workload

    4. Start the TPC-C workload, pointing it at the IP address of the load
       balancer:

       copy

 $ workload run tpcc \
 --drop \
 --init \
 --duration=20m \
 --tolerate-errors \
 "postgresql://root@<IP ADDRESS OF LOAD BALANCER>:26257/tpcc?sslmode=disable"

       This command runs the TPC-C workload against the cluster for 20
       minutes, loading 1 "warehouse" of data initially and then issuing
       about 12 queries per minute via 10 "worker" threads. These workers
       share SQL connections since individual workers are idle for long
       periods of time between queries.

       Tip:
       For more tpcc options, use workload run tpcc --help. For details about
       other load generators included in workload, use workload run --help.

    5. To monitor the load generator's progress, open the Admin UI by
       pointing a browser to the address in the admin field in the standard
       output of any node on startup.

       Since the load generator is pointed at the load balancer, the
       connections will be evenly distributed across nodes. To verify this,
       click Metrics on the left, select the SQL dashboard, and then check
       the SQL Connections graph. You can use the Graph menu to filter the
       graph for specific nodes.

Step 9. Monitor the cluster

   Despite CockroachDB's various built-in safeguards against failure, it is
   critical to actively monitor the overall health and performance of a
   cluster running in production and to create alerting rules that promptly
   send notifications when there are events that require investigation or
   intervention.

   For details about available monitoring options and the most important
   events and metrics to alert on, see Monitoring and Alerting.

Step 10. Scale the cluster

   You can start the nodes manually or automate the process using systemd.

   Manual systemd

   For each additional node you want to add to the cluster, complete the
   following steps:

    1. SSH to the machine where you want the node to run.

    2. Download the CockroachDB archive for Linux, and extract the binary:

       copy

 $ wget -qO- https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64.tgz \
 | tar  xvz

    3. Copy the binary into the PATH:

       copy

 $ cp -i cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/

       If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with sudo.

    4. Run the cockroach start command, passing the new node's address as the
       --advertise-addr flag and pointing --join to the three existing nodes
       (also include --locality if you set it earlier).

       copy

 $ cockroach start \
 --insecure \
 --advertise-addr=<node4 address> \
 --join=<node1 address>,<node2 address>,<node3 address> \
 --cache=.25 \
 --max-sql-memory=.25 \
 --background

    5. Update your load balancer to recognize the new node.

   For each additional node you want to add to the cluster, complete the
   following steps:

    1. SSH to the machine where you want the node to run. Ensure you are
       logged in as the root user.

    2. Download the CockroachDB archive for Linux, and extract the binary:

       copy

 $ wget -qO- https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64.tgz \
 | tar  xvz

    3. Copy the binary into the PATH:

       copy

 $ cp -i cockroach-v20.2.0-alpha.2.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/

       If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with sudo.

    4. Create the Cockroach directory:

       copy

 $ mkdir /var/lib/cockroach

    5. Create a Unix user named cockroach:

       copy

 $ useradd cockroach

    6. Change the ownership of Cockroach directory to the user cockroach:

       copy

 $ chown cockroach /var/lib/cockroach

    7. Download the sample configuration template:

       copy

 $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/v20.2/prod-deployment/insecurecockroachdb.service

       Alternatively, you can create the file yourself and copy the script
       into it:

       copy

 [Unit]
 Description=Cockroach Database cluster node
 Requires=network.target
 [Service]
 Type=notify
 WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/cockroach
 ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cockroach start --insecure --advertise-addr=<node1 address> --join=<node1 address>,<node2 address>,<node3 address> --cache=.25 --max-sql-memory=.25
 TimeoutStopSec=60
 Restart=always
 RestartSec=10
 StandardOutput=syslog
 StandardError=syslog
 SyslogIdentifier=cockroach
 User=cockroach
 [Install]
 WantedBy=default.target


       Save the file in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory

    8. Customize the sample configuration template for your deployment:

       Specify values for the following flags in the sample configuration
       template:

       Flag             Description                                           
                        Specifies the IP address/hostname and port to tell    
                        other nodes to use. The port number can be omitted,   
                        in which case it defaults to 26257.                   
                                                                              
                        This value must route to an IP address the node is    
       --advertise-addr listening on (with --listen-addr unspecified, the     
                        node listens on all IP addresses).                    
                                                                              
                        In some networking scenarios, you may need to use     
                        --advertise-addr and/or --listen-addr differently.    
                        For more details, see Networking.                     
                        Identifies the address of 3-5 of the initial nodes of 
       --join           the cluster. These addresses should match the         
                        addresses that the target nodes are advertising.      

    9. Repeat these steps for each additional node that you want in your
       cluster.

Step 11. Use the cluster

   Now that your deployment is working, you can:

    1. Implement your data model.
    2. Create users and grant them privileges.
    3. Connect your application. Be sure to connect your application to the
       GCE load balancer, not to a CockroachDB node.
