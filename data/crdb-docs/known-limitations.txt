   This page describes newly identified limitations in the CockroachDB
   v20.2.0-alpha.2 release as well as unresolved limitations identified in
   earlier releases.

New limitations

  Primary key changes and zone configs

   When you change a table's primary key with ALTER PRIMARY KEY, any zone
   configurations for that table or its secondary indexes will no longer
   apply.

   As a workaround, recreate the zone configurations after changing the
   table's primary key.

  ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT in high-priority transactions containing DDL

   Transactions with priority HIGH that contain DDL and ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT
   are not supported, as they could result in a deadlock. For example:

 > BEGIN PRIORITY HIGH; SAVEPOINT s; CREATE TABLE t(x INT); ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT s;

 ERROR: unimplemented: cannot use ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT in a HIGH PRIORITY transaction containing DDL
 SQLSTATE: 0A000
 HINT: You have attempted to use a feature that is not yet implemented.

  Column name from an outer column inside a subquery differs from PostgreSQL

   CockroachDB returns the column name from an outer column inside a subquery
   as ?column?, unlike PostgreSQL. For example:

 > SELECT (SELECT t.*) FROM (VALUES (1)) t(x);

   CockroachDB:

   ?column?
 ------------
          1

   PostgreSQL:

  x

  Privileges required to access to certain virtual tables differs from
  PostgreSQL

   Access to certain virtual tables in the pg_catalog and information_schema
   schemas require more privileges than in PostgreSQL. For example, in
   CockroachDB, access to pg_catalog.pg_types requires the SELECT privilege
   on the current database, whereas this privilege is not required in
   PostgreSQL.

  Concurrent SQL shells overwrite each other's history

   The built-in SQL shell stores its command history in a single file by
   default (.cockroachsql_history). When running multiple instances of the
   SQL shell on the same machine, therefore, each shell's command history can
   get overwritten in unexpected ways.

   As a workaround, set the COCKROACH_SQL_CLI_HISTORY environment variable to
   different values for the two different shells, for example:

   copy

 $ export COCKROACH_SQL_CLI_HISTORY=.cockroachsql_history_shell_1

   copy

 $ export COCKROACH_SQL_CLI_HISTORY=.cockroachsql_history_shell_2

Unresolved limitations

  Subqueries in SET statements

   It is not currently possible to use a subquery in a SET or SET CLUSTER
   SETTING statement. For example:

   copy

 > SET application_name = (SELECT 'a' || 'b');

 ERROR: invalid value for parameter "application_name": "(SELECT 'a' || 'b')"
 SQLSTATE: 22023
 DETAIL: subqueries are not allowed in SET

  Filtering by now() results in a full table scan

   When filtering a query by now(), the cost-based optimizer currently cannot
   constrain an index on the filtered timestamp column. This results in a
   full table scan. For example:

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE bydate (a TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, INDEX (a));

   copy

 > EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM bydate WHERE a > (now() - '1h'::interval);

   tree |    field    |       description
 -------+-------------+---------------------------
        | distributed | true
        | vectorized  | false
   scan |             |
        | table       | bydate@primary
        | spans       | FULL SCAN
        | filter      | a > (now() - '01:00:00')
 (6 rows)

   As a workaround, pass the correct date into the query as a parameter to a
   prepared query with a placeholder, which will allow the optimizer to
   constrain the index correctly:

   copy

 > PREPARE q AS SELECT * FROM bydate WHERE a > ($1::timestamp - '1h'::interval);

   copy

 > EXECUTE q ('2020-05-12 00:00:00');

  Enterprise BACKUP does not capture database/table/column comments

   The COMMENT ON statement associates comments to databases, tables, or
   columns. However, the internal table (system.comments) in which these
   comments are stored is not captured by enterprise BACKUP.

   As a workaround, alongside a BACKUP, run the cockroach dump command with
   --dump-mode=schema for each table in the backup. This will emit COMMENT ON
   statements alongside CREATE statements.

  Adding stores to a node

   After a node has initially joined a cluster, it is not possible to add
   additional stores to the node. Stopping the node and restarting it with
   additional stores causes the node to not reconnect to the cluster.

   To work around this limitation, decommission the node, remove its data
   directory, and then run cockroach start to join the cluster again as a new
   node.

  CHECK constraint validation for INSERT ON CONFLICT differs from PostgreSQL

   CockroachDB validates CHECK constraints on the results of INSERT ON
   CONFLICT statements, preventing new or changed rows from violating the
   constraint. Unlike PostgreSQL, CockroachDB does not also validate CHECK
   constraints on the input rows of INSERT ON CONFLICT statements.

   If this difference matters to your client, you can INSERT ON CONFLICT from
   a SELECT statement and check the inserted value as part of the SELECT. For
   example, instead of defining CHECK (x > 0) on t.x and using INSERT INTO
   t(x) VALUES (3) ON CONFLICT (x) DO UPDATE SET x = excluded.x, you could do
   the following:

   copy

 > INSERT INTO t (x)
     SELECT if (x <= 0, crdb_internal.force_error('23514', 'check constraint violated'), x)
       FROM (values (3)) AS v(x)
     ON CONFLICT (x)
       DO UPDATE SET x = excluded.x;

   An x value less than 1 would result in the following error:

 pq: check constraint violated

  Cold starts of large clusters may require manual intervention

   If a cluster contains a large amount of data (>500GiB / node), and all
   nodes are stopped and then started at the same time, clusters can enter a
   state where they're unable to startup without manual intervention. In this
   state, logs fill up rapidly with messages like refusing gossip from node
   x; forwarding to node y, and data and metrics may become inaccessible.

   To exit this state, you should:

    1. Stop all nodes.
    2. Set the following environment variables: COCKROACH_SCAN_INTERVAL=60m,
       and COCKROACH_SCAN_MIN_IDLE_TIME=1s.
    3. Restart the cluster.

   Once restarted, monitor the Replica Quiescence graph on the Replication
   Dashboard. When >90% of the replicas have become quiescent, conduct a
   rolling restart and remove the environment variables. Make sure that
   under-replicated ranges do not increase between restarts.

   Tracking Github Issue

  Requests to restarted node in need of snapshots may hang

   When a node is offline, the Raft logs for the ranges on the node get
   truncated. When the node comes back online, it therefore often needs Raft
   snapshots to get many of its ranges back up-to-date. While in this state,
   requests to a range will hang until its snapshot has been applied, which
   can take a long time.

   To work around this limitation, you can adjust the
   kv.snapshot_recovery.max_rate cluster setting to temporarily relax the
   throughput rate limiting applied to snapshots. For example, changing the
   rate limiting from the default 8 MB/s, at which 1 GB of snapshots takes at
   least 2 minutes, to 64 MB/s can result in an 8x speedup in snapshot
   transfers and, therefore, a much shorter interruption of requests to an
   impacted node:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.snapshot_recovery.max_rate = '64mb';

   Before increasing this value, however, verify that you will not end up
   saturating your network interfaces, and once the problem has resolved, be
   sure to reset to the original value.

  Location-based time zone names

   Certain features of CockroachDB require time zone data, for example, to
   support using location-based names as time zone identifiers. When starting
   a CockroachDB node on a machine missing time zone data, the node will not
   start.

   To resolve this issue on Linux, install the tzdata library (sometimes
   called tz or zoneinfo).

   To resolve this issue on Windows, download Go's official zoneinfo.zip and
   set the ZONEINFO environment variable to point to the zip file. For
   step-by-step guidance on setting environment variables on Windows, see
   this external article.

   Make sure to do this across all nodes in the cluster and to keep this time
   zone data up-to-date.

  Database and table renames are not transactional

   Database and table renames using RENAME DATABASE and RENAME TABLE are not
   transactional.

   Specifically, when run inside a BEGIN ... COMMIT block, it’s possible for
   a rename to be half-done - not persisted in storage, but visible to other
   nodes or other transactions. For more information, see Table renaming
   considerations. For an issue tracking this limitation, see
   cockroach#12123.

  Change data capture

   Change data capture (CDC) provides efficient, distributed, row-level
   change feeds into Apache Kafka for downstream processing such as
   reporting, caching, or full-text indexing.

     * Changefeeds only work on tables with a single column family (which is
       the default for new tables).
     * Changefeeds do not share internal buffers, so each running changefeed
       will increase total memory usage. To watch multiple tables, we
       recommend creating a changefeed with a comma-separated list of tables.
     * Many DDL queries (including TRUNCATE and DROP TABLE) will cause errors
       on a changefeed watching the affected tables. You will need to start a
       new changefeed.
     * Changefeeds cannot be backed up or restored.
     * Partial or intermittent sink unavailability may impact changefeed
       stability; however, ordering guarantees will still hold for as long as
       a changefeed remains active.
     * Changefeeds cannot be altered. To alter, cancel the changefeed and
       create a new one with updated settings from where it left off.
     * Additional target options will be added, including partitions and
       ranges of primary key rows.
     * There is an open correctness issue with changefeeds connected to cloud
       storage sinks where new row information will display with a lower
       timestamp than what has already been emitted, which violates our
       ordering guarantees.
     * Changefeeds do not pick up data ingested with the IMPORT INTO
       statement.
     * Using a cloud storage sink only works with JSON and emits
       newline-delimited json files.

  Admin UI may become inaccessible for secure clusters

   Accessing the Admin UI for a secure cluster now requires login information
   (i.e., username and password). This login information is stored in a
   system table that is replicated like other data in the cluster. If a
   majority of the nodes with the replicas of the system table data go down,
   users will be locked out of the Admin UI.

  AS OF SYSTEM TIME in SELECT statements

   AS OF SYSTEM TIME can only be used in a top-level SELECT statement. That
   is, we do not support statements like INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM t2 AS OF
   SYSTEM TIME <time> or two subselects in the same statement with differing
   AS OF SYSTEM TIME arguments.

  Large index keys can impair performance

   The use of tables with very large primary or secondary index keys (>32KB)
   can result in excessive memory usage. Specifically, if the primary or
   secondary index key is larger than 32KB the default indexing scheme for
   RocksDB SSTables breaks down and causes the index to be excessively large.
   The index is pinned in memory by default for performance.

   To work around this issue, we recommend limiting the size of primary and
   secondary keys to 4KB, which you must account for manually. Note that most
   columns are 8B (exceptions being STRING and JSON), which still allows for
   very complex key structures.

  Admin UI: Statements page latency reports

   The Statements page does not correctly report "mean latency" or "latency
   by phase" for statements that result in schema changes or other background
   jobs.

  Using LIKE...ESCAPE in WHERE and HAVING constraints

   CockroachDB tries to optimize most comparisons operators in WHERE and
   HAVING clauses into constraints on SQL indexes by only accessing selected
   rows. This is done for LIKE clauses when a common prefix for all selected
   rows can be determined in the search pattern (e.g., ... LIKE 'Joe%').
   However, this optimization is not yet available if the ESCAPE keyword is
   also used.

  Using SQLAlchemy with CockroachDB

   Users of the SQLAlchemy adapter provided by Cockroach Labs must upgrade
   the adapter to the latest release before upgrading to CockroachDB v20.2.

  Admin UI: CPU percentage calculation

   For multi-core systems, the user CPU percent can be greater than 100%.
   Full utilization of one core is considered as 100% CPU usage. If you have
   n cores, then the user CPU percent can range from 0% (indicating an idle
   system) to (n*100)% (indicating full utilization).

  Admin UI: CPU count in containerized environments

   When CockroachDB is run in a containerized environment (e.g., Kubernetes),
   the Admin UI does not detect CPU limits applied to a container. Instead,
   the UI displays the actual number of CPUs provisioned on a VM.

  TRUNCATE does not behave like DELETE

   TRUNCATE is not a DML statement, but instead works as a DDL statement. Its
   limitations are the same as other DDL statements, which are outlined in
   Online Schema Changes: Limitations

  DISTINCT operations cannot operate over JSON values

   CockroachDB does not currently key-encode JSON values, which prevents
   DISTINCT filters from working on them.

   As a workaround, you can return the JSON field's values to a string using
   the ->> operator, e.g., SELECT DISTINCT col->>'field'....

  Current sequence value not checked when updating min/max value

   Altering the minimum or maximum value of a series does not check the
   current value of a series. This means that it is possible to silently set
   the maximum to a value less than, or a minimum value greater than, the
   current value.

  Using default_int_size session variable in batch of statements

   When setting the default_int_size session variable in a batch of
   statements such as SET default_int_size='int4'; SELECT 1::IN, the
   default_int_size variable will not take affect until the next statement.
   This happens because statement parsing takes place asynchronously from
   statement execution.

   As a workaround, set default_int_size via your database driver, or ensure
   that SET default_int_size is in its own statement.

  Importing data using the PostgreSQL COPY protocol

   Currently, the built-in SQL shell provided with CockroachDB (cockroach sql
   / cockroach demo) does not support importing data using the COPY
   statement. Users can use the psql client command provided with PostgreSQL
   to load this data into CockroachDB instead. For details, see Import from
   generic SQL dump.

  Dumping a table with no user-visible columns

   It is not currently possible to use cockroach dump to dump the schema and
   data of a table with no user-defined columns. See #35462 for more details.

  Dumping a table with collations

   When using cockroach dump to dump the data of a table containing
   collations, the resulting INSERTs do not include the relevant collation
   clauses. For example:

   copy

 $ cockroach start-single-node --insecure

   copy

 $ cockroach sql --insecure

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE de_names (name STRING COLLATE de PRIMARY KEY);

   copy

 > INSERT INTO de_names VALUES
     ('Backhaus' COLLATE de),
     ('Bär' COLLATE de),
     ('Baz' COLLATE de)
   ;

   copy

 > q

   copy

 $ cockroach dump defaultdb de_names --insecure > dump.sql

   copy

 $ cat dump.sql

 CREATE TABLE de_names (
     name STRING COLLATE de NOT NULL,
     CONSTRAINT "primary" PRIMARY KEY (name ASC),
     FAMILY "primary" (name)
 );

 INSERT INTO de_names (name) VALUES
     ('Backhaus'),
     (e'B\u00E4r'),
     ('Baz');

   Tracking GitHub Issue

  Import with a high amount of disk contention

   IMPORT can sometimes fail with a "context canceled" error, or can restart
   itself many times without ever finishing. If this is happening, it is
   likely due to a high amount of disk contention. This can be mitigated by
   setting the kv.bulk_io_write.max_rate cluster setting to a value below
   your max disk write speed. For example, to set it to 10MB/s, execute:

   copy

 > SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.bulk_io_write.max_rate = '10MB';

  Assigning latitude/longitude for the Node Map

   You cannot assign latitude/longitude coordinates to localities if the
   components of your localities have the same name. For example, consider
   the following partial configuration:

   Node  Region  Datacenter   
   Node1 us-east datacenter-1 
   Node2 us-west datacenter-1 

   In this case, if you try to set the latitude/longitude coordinates to the
   datacenter level of the localities, you will get the "primary key exists"
   error and the Node Map will not be displayed. You can, however, set the
   latitude/longitude coordinates to the region components of the localities,
   and the Node Map will be displayed.

  Placeholders in PARTITION BY

   When defining a table partition, either during table creation or table
   alteration, it is not possible to use placeholders in the PARTITION BY
   clause.

  Adding a column with sequence-based DEFAULT values

   It is currently not possible to add a column to a table when the column
   uses a sequence as the DEFAULT value, for example:

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE t (x INT);

   copy

 > INSERT INTO t(x) VALUES (1), (2), (3);

   copy

 > CREATE SEQUENCE s;

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN y INT DEFAULT nextval('s');

 ERROR: nextval(): unimplemented: cannot evaluate scalar expressions containing sequence operations in this context

  Available capacity metric in the Admin UI

   If you are testing your deployment locally with multiple CockroachDB nodes
   running on a single machine (this is not recommended in production), you
   must explicitly set the store size per node in order to display the
   correct capacity. Otherwise, the machine's actual disk capacity will be
   counted as a separate store for each node, thus inflating the computed
   capacity.

  Schema changes within transactions

   Within a single transaction:

     * DDL statements cannot be mixed with DML statements. As a workaround,
       you can split the statements into separate transactions. For more
       details, see examples of unsupported statements.
     * As of version v2.1, you can run schema changes inside the same
       transaction as a CREATE TABLE statement. For more information, see
       this example.
     * A CREATE TABLE statement containing FOREIGN KEY or INTERLEAVE clauses
       cannot be followed by statements that reference the new table.
     * A table cannot be dropped and then recreated with the same name. This
       is not possible within a single transaction because DROP TABLE does
       not immediately drop the name of the table. As a workaround, split the
       DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements into separate transactions.
     * Schema change DDL statements inside a multi-statement transaction can
       fail while other statements succeed.
     * As of v19.1, some schema changes can be used in combination in a
       single ALTER TABLE statement. For a list of commands that can be
       combined, see ALTER TABLE. For a demonstration, see Add and rename
       columns atomically.
   Note:

   If a schema change within a transaction fails, manual intervention may be
   needed to determine which has failed. After determining which schema
   change(s) failed, you can then retry the schema changes.

  Schema change DDL statements inside a multi-statement transaction can fail
  while other statements succeed

   Schema change DDL statements that run inside a multi-statement transaction
   with non-DDL statements can fail at COMMIT time, even if other statements
   in the transaction succeed. This leaves such transactions in a "partially
   committed, partially aborted" state that may require manual intervention
   to determine whether the DDL statements succeeded.

   If such a failure occurs, CockroachDB will emit a new CockroachDB-specific
   error code, XXA00, and the following error message:

 transaction committed but schema change aborted with error: <description of error>
 HINT: Some of the non-DDL statements may have committed successfully, but some of the DDL statement(s) failed.
 Manual inspection may be required to determine the actual state of the database.

   Note:

   This limitation exists in versions of CockroachDB prior to 19.2. In these
   older versions, CockroachDB returned the Postgres error code 40003,
   "statement completion unknown".

   Warning:

   If you must execute schema change DDL statements inside a multi-statement
   transaction, we strongly recommend checking for this error code and
   handling it appropriately every time you execute such transactions.

   This error will occur in various scenarios, including but not limited to:

     * Creating a unique index fails because values aren't unique.
     * The evaluation of a computed value fails.
     * Adding a constraint (or a column with a constraint) fails because the
       constraint is violated for the default/computed values in the column.

   To see an example of this error, start by creating the following table.

   copy

 CREATE TABLE T(x INT);
 INSERT INTO T(x) VALUES (1), (2), (3);

   Then, enter the following multi-statement transaction, which will trigger
   the error.

   copy

 BEGIN;
 ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT unique_x UNIQUE(x);
 INSERT INTO T(x) VALUES (3);
 COMMIT;

 pq: transaction committed but schema change aborted with error: (23505): duplicate key value (x)=(3) violates unique constraint "unique_x"
 HINT: Some of the non-DDL statements may have committed successfully, but some of the DDL statement(s) failed.
 Manual inspection may be required to determine the actual state of the database.

   In this example, the INSERT statement committed, but the ALTER TABLE
   statement adding a UNIQUE constraint failed. We can verify this by looking
   at the data in table t and seeing that the additional non-unique value 3
   was successfully inserted.

   copy

 SELECT * FROM t;

   x
 +---+
   1
   2
   3
   3
 (4 rows)

  Schema changes between executions of prepared statements

   When the schema of a table targeted by a prepared statement changes before
   the prepared statement is executed, CockroachDB allows the prepared
   statement to return results based on the changed table schema, for
   example:

   copy

 > CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY);

   copy

 > PREPARE prep1 AS SELECT * FROM users;

   copy

 > ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN name STRING;

   copy

 > INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Max Roach');

   copy

 > EXECUTE prep1;

 +----+-----------+
 | id |   name    |
 +----+-----------+
 |  1 | Max Roach |
 +----+-----------+
 (1 row)

   It's therefore recommended to not use SELECT * in queries that will be
   repeated, via prepared statements or otherwise.

   Also, a prepared INSERT, UPSERT, or DELETE statement acts inconsistently
   when the schema of the table being written to is changed before the
   prepared statement is executed:

     * If the number of columns has increased, the prepared statement returns
       an error but nonetheless writes the data.
     * If the number of columns remains the same but the types have changed,
       the prepared statement writes the data and does not return an error.

  INSERT ON CONFLICT vs. UPSERT

   When inserting/updating all columns of a table, and the table has no
   secondary indexes, we recommend using an UPSERT statement instead of the
   equivalent INSERT ON CONFLICT statement. Whereas INSERT ON CONFLICT always
   performs a read to determine the necessary writes, the UPSERT statement
   writes without reading, making it faster.

   This issue is particularly relevant when using a simple SQL table of two
   columns to simulate direct KV access. In this case, be sure to use the
   UPSERT statement.

  Using \| to perform a large input in the SQL shell

   In the built-in SQL shell, using the \| operator to perform a large number
   of inputs from a file can cause the server to close the connection. This
   is because \| sends the entire file as a single query to the server, which
   can exceed the upper bound on the size of a packet the server can accept
   from any client (16MB).

   As a workaround, execute the file from the command line with cat data.sql
   | cockroach sql instead of from within the interactive shell.

  New values generated by DEFAULT expressions during ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN

   When executing an ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN statement with a DEFAULT
   expression, new values generated:

     * use the default search path regardless of the search path configured
       in the current session via SET SEARCH_PATH.
     * use the UTC time zone regardless of the time zone configured in the
       current session via SET TIME ZONE.
     * have no default database regardless of the default database configured
       in the current session via SET DATABASE, so you must specify the
       database of any tables they reference.
     * use the transaction timestamp for the statement_timestamp() function
       regardless of the time at which the ALTER statement was issued.

  Load-based lease rebalancing in uneven latency deployments

   When nodes are started with the --locality flag, CockroachDB attempts to
   place the replica lease holder (the replica that client requests are
   forwarded to) on the node closest to the source of the request. This means
   as client requests move geographically, so too does the replica lease
   holder.

   However, you might see increased latency caused by a consistently high
   rate of lease transfers between datacenters in the following case:

     * Your cluster runs in datacenters which are very different distances
       away from each other.
     * Each node was started with a single tier of --locality, e.g.,
       --locality=datacenter=a.
     * Most client requests get sent to a single datacenter because that's
       where all your application traffic is.

   To detect if this is happening, open the Admin UI, select the Queues
   dashboard, hover over the Replication Queue graph, and check the Leases
   Transferred / second data point. If the value is consistently larger than
   0, you should consider stopping and restarting each node with additional
   tiers of locality to improve request latency.

   For example, let's say that latency is 10ms from nodes in datacenter A to
   nodes in datacenter B but is 100ms from nodes in datacenter A to nodes in
   datacenter C. To ensure A's and B's relative proximity is factored into
   lease holder rebalancing, you could restart the nodes in datacenter A and
   B with a common region, --locality=region=foo,datacenter=a and
   --locality=region=foo,datacenter=b, while restarting nodes in datacenter C
   with a different region, --locality=region=bar,datacenter=c.

  Overload resolution for collated strings

   Many string operations are not properly overloaded for collated strings,
   for example:

   copy

 > SELECT 'string1' || 'string2';

 +------------------------+
 | 'string1' || 'string2' |
 +------------------------+
 | string1string2         |
 +------------------------+
 (1 row)

  Max size of a single column family

   When creating or updating a row, if the combined size of all values in a
   single column family exceeds the max range size (512 MiB by default) for
   the table, the operation may fail, or cluster performance may suffer.

   As a workaround, you can either manually split a table's columns into
   multiple column families, or you can create a table-specific zone
   configuration with an increased max range size.

  Simultaneous client connections and running queries on a single node

   When a node has both a high number of client connections and running
   queries, the node may crash due to memory exhaustion. This is due to
   CockroachDB not accurately limiting the number of clients and queries
   based on the amount of available RAM on the node.

   To prevent memory exhaustion, monitor each node's memory usage and ensure
   there is some margin between maximum CockroachDB memory usage and
   available system RAM. For more details about memory usage in CockroachDB,
   see this blog post.

  SQL subexpressions and memory usage

   Many SQL subexpressions (e.g., ORDER BY, UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT, GROUP BY,
   subqueries) accumulate intermediate results in RAM on the node processing
   the query. If the operator attempts to process more rows than can fit into
   RAM, the node will either crash or report a memory capacity error. For
   more details about memory usage in CockroachDB, see this blog post.

  Query planning for OR expressions

   Given a query like SELECT * FROM foo WHERE a > 1 OR b > 2, even if there
   are appropriate indexes to satisfy both a > 1 and b > 2, the query planner
   performs a full table or index scan because it cannot use both conditions
   at once.

  Privileges for DELETE and UPDATE

   Every DELETE or UPDATE statement constructs a SELECT statement, even when
   no WHERE clause is involved. As a result, the user executing DELETE or
   UPDATE requires both the DELETE and SELECT or UPDATE and SELECT privileges
   on the table.

  Correlated common table expressions

   CockroachDB does not support correlated common table expressions. This
   means that a CTE cannot refer to a variable defined outside the scope of
   that CTE.

   For example, the following query returns an error:

   copy

 > SELECT * FROM users
   WHERE id =
     (WITH rides_home AS
       (SELECT revenue FROM rides
        WHERE end_address = address)
      SELECT rider_id FROM rides_home);

 ERROR: CTEs may not be correlated
 SQLSTATE: 0A000

   This query returns an error because the WITH rides_home clause references
   a column (address) returned by the SELECT statement at the top level of
   the query, outside the rides_home CTE definition.

   For details, see the tracking issue: cockroachdb/cockroach#42540.
