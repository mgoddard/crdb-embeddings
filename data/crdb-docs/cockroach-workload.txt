   CockroachDB comes with built-in load generators for simulating different
   types of client workloads, printing per-operation statistics and totals
   after a specific duration or max number of operations. To run one of these
   load generators, use the cockroach workload command as described below.

   Warning:

   The cockroach workload command is experimental. The interface and output
   are subject to change.

Synopsis

   Create the schema for a workload:

 $ cockroach workload init <workload> <flags> '<connection string>'

   Run a workload:

 $ cockroach workload run <workload> <flags> '<connection string>'

   View help:

 $ cockroach workload --help

 $ cockroach workload init --help

 $ cockroach workload init <workload> --help

 $ cockroach workload run --help

 $ cockroach workload run <workload> --help

Subcommands

   Command Usage                                                              
   init    Load the schema for the workload. You run this command once for a  
           given schema.                                                      
           Run a workload. You can run this command multiple times from       
   run     different machines to increase concurrency. See Concurrency for    
           more details.                                                      

Concurrency

   There are two ways to increase the concurrency of a workload:

     * Increase the concurrency of a single workload instance by running
       cockroach workload run <workload> with the --concurrency flag set to a
       value higher than the default.
     * Run multiple instances of a workload in parallel by running cockroach
       workload run <workload> multiple times from different machines.

Workloads

   Workload Description                                                       
            Models a set of accounts with currency balances.                  
   bank                                                                       
            For this workload, you run workload init to load the schema and   
            then workload run to generate data.                               
            Loads an intro database, with one table, mytable, with a hidden   
            message.                                                          
   intro                                                                      
            For this workload, you run only workload init to load the data.   
            The workload run subcommand is not applicable.                    
            Reads and writes to keys spread (by default, uniformly at random) 
            across the cluster.                                               
   kv                                                                         
            For this workload, you run workload init to load the schema and   
            then workload run to generate data.                               
            Simulates a workload for the MovR example application.            
   movr                                                                       
            For this workload, you run workload init to load the schema and   
            then workload run to generate data.                               
            Loads a startrek database, with two tables, episodes and quotes.  
   startrek                                                                   
            For this workload, you run only workload init to load the data.   
            The workload run subcommand is not applicable.                    
            Simulates a transaction processing workload using a rich schema   
            of multiple tables.                                               
   tpcc                                                                       
            For this workload, you run workload init to load the schema and   
            then workload run to generate data.                               
            Simulates a high-scale key value workload, either read-heavy,     
            write-heavy, or scan-based, with additional customizations.       
   ycsb                                                                       
            For this workload, you run workload init to load the schema and   
            then workload run to generate data.                               

   Note:

   cockroach workload sets the application_name for its workload queries to
   the name of the workload that is used. You can filter queries on
   application_name on the Statements page of the Admin UI, or in a SHOW
   QUERIES statement.

Flags

   Note:

   The cockroach workload command does not support connection or security
   flags like other cockroach commands. Instead, you must use a connection
   string at the end of the command.

  intro and startrek workloads

   Note:

   These workloads generate data but do not offer the ability to run
   continuous load. Thus, only the init subcommand is supported.

  Logging

   By default, the cockroach workload command logs errors to stderr.

   If you need to troubleshoot this command's behavior, you can change its
   logging behavior.

Examples

   These examples assume that you have already started an insecure cluster
   locally:

   copy

 $ cockroach start \
 --insecure \
 --listen-addr=localhost

  Run the bank workload

    1. Load the initial schema:

       copy

 $ cockroach workload init bank \
 'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'

    2. Run the workload for 1 minute:

       copy

 $ cockroach workload run bank \
 --duration=1m \
 'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'

       You'll see per-operation statistics print to standard output every
       second:

       After the specified duration (1 minute in this case), the workload
       will stop and you'll see totals printed to standard output:

  Run the kv workload

    1. Load the initial schema:

       copy

 $ cockroach workload init kv \
 'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'

    2. Run the workload for 1 minute:

       copy

 $ cockroach workload run kv \

       You'll see per-operation statistics print to standard output every

  Customize the frequency and format of per-operation statistics

   To customize the frequency of per-operation statistics, use the
   --display-every flag, with ns, us, ms, s, m, and h as valid time units. To
   customize the format of per-operation statistics, use the --display-format
   flag, with incremental-json or simple (default) as options.

    1. Load the initial schema and data:

       copy

 $ cockroach workload init ycsb \
 'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'

    2. Run the workload for 1 minute, printing the output every 5 seconds as
       JSON:

       copy

 $ cockroach workload run ycsb \
 --duration=1m \
 --display-every=5s \
 --display-format=incremental-json \
 'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'

       When using incremental-json, note that totals are not printed at the
       end of the workload's duration.
